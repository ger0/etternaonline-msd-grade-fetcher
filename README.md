# Etterna MSD fetcher for different score grades

## How to use the script:
1. Make sure you have greasemonkey/tampermonkey installed in your browser.
2. Open the script in your browser (click "Raw" butotn on GitHub, it should automatically prompt to install the script).
3. Once installed, navigate to an Etterna score page (e.g., https://etternaonline.com/users/USERNAME) and check the console (F12) for the MSD values. 

WIP: Currently only fetches for AAA scores, DOM modifications will be added later.

If script installation doesn't prompt automatically, you can manually copy the code from the GitHub repository and create a new userscript in your greasemonkey/tampermonkey extension.
